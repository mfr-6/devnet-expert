# DevNet Expert Journey by Mateusz Frak

This repository contains my notes, scripts created and collected between 1.01.2024 and 31.03.2024. In that period I worked through most of the topics on my own, but eventually switched to the Andreas' bootcamp materials later on.

I believe the materials you can find here are still valuable and will give you the idea how I've tried to go through all the topics. Treat all you see here as a inspiration, something that could unlock you when you are stuck. This is NOT production ready code at any kind.

Most of that time I used DevNet Sandbox for labbing and it should be enough for most scenarios.

I got inspired to do this thanks to Danny Wade who did the same and shared his resources in the same way. I found it very useful, thank you Danny.
Here you can find Danny's repository: https://github.com/dannywade/devnet-expert

Good luck on your DevNet Expert Lab Exam!

I'd love to hear back from you. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn, mail - all the links are available on my website.

# CAUTION

I share the all content as is. After going through the code/solutions, I've discovered many things I would do differently after 10 months of study. Entire blueprint was not covered, few scripts might not work properly. Codebase could contain unfinished work.

Those solutions also doesn't reflect my methology of solving software issues in a real-life scenarios. All the content is tailored to DevNet Expert blueprint so it doesn't contain extra solutions I usually do on a daily basis, for example - unit tests along with TDD, OOP and many more. The code only uses the frameworks that were listed on Software and Equipment list published by Cisco.

Please note that you will find plain text passwords in scripts and other files. Those are well-known passwords used to access resources in DevNet Sandbox. Please keep in mind that storing your passwords IS NOT a good practice and you shouldn't do this.
